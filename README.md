# Paris Front-End
## About
Paris is an app that ensures that you are either at a certain location by a certain time or ensures that you're not. You can use the back-end to set a location and time, and then use this front-end to verify that you are/are not at the right location at the right time.

## Code Quality
I created this product for myself to solve a pressing problem. Given that I was the sole user, and I needed a quick
solution that wouldn't be used or changed very much in the long term, I don't always have things like good 
documentation, small functions, etc. This would change if the users and use cases were different.
## Running The Project

After doing this, Expo will generate a QR code in your terminal.
You'll need to download the Expo app and scan the QR code to access the app.
